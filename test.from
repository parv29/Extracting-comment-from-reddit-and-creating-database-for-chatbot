I've always been of the mindset that a business (publicly or privately owned) that is unsustainable isn't worth subsidizing.  If the public really wanted the service provided, someone would figure out how to provide the service and make it sustainable.  This is not a function of the government.
Actually no. Under Prop 19, smoking in public or around minors is still illegal. Now these will only be infractions instead of misdemeanors.
